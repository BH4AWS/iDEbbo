iDEbbo

This work releases the source code of iDEbbo (iDE/BBO: An Improved Biogeography-Based Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution).

We propose an iDE/BBO algorithm referring to the components from CPBBOCO algorithm [1] 
and the differential evolution (DE) theory. 

To further improve the algorithm exploration ability and mitigate these weaknesses, 
our algorithm designs a hybrid migration method and a scalable direction mutation operation.

Empirical results demonstrate that our iDE/BBO can achieve the better algorithm performance by
comparing with two BBO variants and three additional evolutionary algorithms.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 23 benchmarks are employed 
from F01 to F23. A more detailed description of these functions can be found in [2,3].


We mainly introduce one type of file and folder structure as follows:
